# TextInput

TextInput fields in bamboo, like other components, are super fast and extremely flexible.

    Single most important resource to implement the default color schemes and pixel perfect design.

    Clear examples how a field should and should not behave.
-   [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/text-input.html)\
    Paper elements implement the closest to the material design, and hence Bamboo takes inspiration from Paper.
-   [Native Base](https://docs.nativebase.io/next/input#page-title)\
    Native base has an elaborate implementation for TextInputs with different variants, addons making it a good resource to take inspiration from. However, the implementation of Native base is not optimal for a data heavy application.

## Personas

-   End user
-   Component consumer

## End user

-   As a user, I want to type into a TextInput field.

## Component consumer

-   As a component consumer, I want to change the keyboard type for TextInput field. ([TextInput:keyboardType](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#keyboardtype)).\
    **NOTE:** this doesn't handle type=number on the web;
-   As a component consumer, I want to supplement my TextInput component with icons/text.
-   As a component consumer, I want the supplementing components react to the state changes such as color change on disabled state etc.
-   As a component consumer, I want the icons are wrapped within the borders of the TextInput field.
-   As a component consumer, I want to have predefined styled TextInputs with different [variant options](../features/variants.md) matching with specific platforms ios and android.
-   As a component consumer, I want to build an TextInput field with custom styles and custom variants.
-   As a component consumer, I want to use TextInputs in different predefined [sizes](../features/sizes.md).
-   As a component consumer, I want to customize certain TextInputs with inline styles.
-   As a component consumer, I want to be able to design entirely redesign my input component.
-   As a component consumer, I want to use [design tokens](../features/design-tokens.md) in my custom styles.

## Variants

1. Outlined
2. Underlined

## Implementation Details

-   Implements [WithElements Interface](../interfaces/WithElementsInterface.md)
