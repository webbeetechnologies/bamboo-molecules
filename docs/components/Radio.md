# Radio has two parts.
## Radio
- As a user, I want to see a radio button.
- As a developer, I want to be able to set a `defaultValue`, `defaultChecked`, `value` and `checked` status.


## Radio Group
- As a developer, I want to be able to configure the radio button options.
- As a developer, I want to be able to listen to the change events.
- As a developer, I want to be able to set a `defaultValue`, `defaultChecked`, `value` and `checked` status.
- As a developer, I want to control how the Radio options are rendered [To decide: Pure Function or an injected component;]
- As a developer, I want the ability to render the Radios horizontally or vertically `direction: "horizontal" | "vertical"`.
