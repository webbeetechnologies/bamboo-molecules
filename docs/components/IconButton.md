# Button
- As a developer, I want to inject the Button (React-native replacement) component and implement it as a button with only one Icon.
- As a user, I want to see feedback from button on hover and focus.
- As a user, I want to know that the button is disabled.


## Implementation Details
- Implements [WithRipple HOC](./HOC/WithRipple.md)
