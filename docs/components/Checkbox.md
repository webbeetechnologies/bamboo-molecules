# Checkbox has two parts.
## Checkbox
- As a user, I want to see a visual aid to toggle a boolean value.
- As a developer, I want to be able to set a `defaultValue`, `defaultChecked`, `value` and `checked` status.


## Checkbox Group
- As a developer, I want to be able to configure the Checkbox options.
- As a developer, I want to be able to listen to the change events.
- As a developer, I want to be able to set a `defaultValue`, `defaultChecked`, `value` and `checked` status.
- As a developer, I want to control how the Checkbox options are rendered [To decide: Pure Function or an injected component;]
- As a developer, I want the ability to render the Checkbox horizontally or vertically `direction: "horizontal" | "vertical"`.
