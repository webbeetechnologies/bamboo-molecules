# Icons
- As a developer, I want to use icons for a better UX.
- As a developer, I want to use different font libraries.
- As a developer, I want that the icon inherits the style from the parent text component.

## Implementation details
- Use react-native-vector-icons
- Give the developer flexibility to import icons of his choice from the react-native-vector-icons library with `type` prop.
- Icons can be styled just like Text.
