# Typeahead
- As a developer, I want to have all the ability that I have with a [Select](./Select.md) component in a Typeahead.
- As a developer, I want that all business logic is abstracted into a separate place; [DataSource](../hooks/useDataSource.md).
- As a user, I want that some options are populated when I focus on the field.
- As a user, I want to see a field to filter my options.
- As a user, I want to see a spinner, when the options are loading.
- As a user, I want to see a performant scrollable list of options as:
    - in mobile/tablet: Modal/dialog with a back button and a search filter to display options.
    - in desktop: Popover dropdown
