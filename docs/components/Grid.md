# Grid

A Grid is a presentational component which renders its children in rows and/or columns.

## Reference: https://github.com/saleel/react-native-super-grid
- SectionList and FlatList components can be replaced to use a custom FlatList and SectionList component.


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see blocks of information in well defined grid layout.
- As a user, I want to see the same information responsively displayed vertically in a mobile/tablet device.
- As a user, I want to see a highly performant UI even though 1000s of items are displayed in a grid.
