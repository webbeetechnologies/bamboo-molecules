Bottom sheets are first class citizens for both Android and iOS.
Bottom sheets are surfaces containing supplementary content, anchored to the bottom of the screen. A bottom sheet usually refers to a UI anchored to the bottom of the screen with content that usually supplements the screen's primary UI region.


Bottom sheets are displayed on user action to populate even supplementary information about the screen.
