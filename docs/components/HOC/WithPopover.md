# WithPopover
- As a developer, I want the ability to show some components around a trigger element.
- As a developer, I want the Popover component is positioned relative to the position of the trigger element.
- As a user, I want that when I click out of the popover; the popover closes.
- As a developer, I want to be able to control whether the popover closes on clicking outside.
- As a developer, I want the ability to control the placement of the popover; `top` | `left` | `bottom` | `right` | `top-left` | `top-right` | `bottom-left` | `bottom-right` | `left-top` | `left-bottom` | `right-top` | `right-bottom` | `auto`
- As a developer, I want to control whether the popover is displayed on hover or on click.
