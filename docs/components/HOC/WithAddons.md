# WithAddons
- As a developer, I want the ability to attach elements before or after my wrapped element.
- As a developer, I want to be able to add icons, buttons, text, inputs, selects, checkboxes, radio, dropdowns, menus as addons.
- As a developer, I want that grouped elements have a default style, such as a border-radius.
- As a developer, I expect that a border radius styles are only added if it's the only child and addons appear seamlessly attached.
