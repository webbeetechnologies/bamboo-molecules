# DatePicker
- As a user, I want to select a Date and Time.
- As a developer, I want that when a user picks a date; he's also required to pick a time.
- As a developer I want to use [DatePicker](./DatePicker.md) and [TimePicker](./TimePicker.md).
- As a developer, I want that the time picker is displayed
    - in a popover
    - in a dialog
    - inline
