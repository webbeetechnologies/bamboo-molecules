# Bamboo Molecules

Bamboo Molecules components are built on top of BambooAtoms; thus, at it's core; Bamboo allows for all the components to be composed by default. That means; you can replace an underlying view by a Styled View of your choice; and that is only the beginning.


Bamboo atoms have minimal theming; and Bamboo Molecules are opinionated styles; however, Molecules allow you to customize or entirely change the theme of a specific component. It is possible to use custom components/styles at a module level.


Molecules is heavily inspired by Material and Cupertino components and thus tries to mimic them to provide a native experience as closely as possible on the react native platform.
