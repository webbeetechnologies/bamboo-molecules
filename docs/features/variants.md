# Variants

Component consumers like to see options, the more the better. Component variants allow a developer to make aesthetically styled variants of components.
Sizes allows a component developer to make design and dimensions extendible.

## Personas

-   Component consumer
-   Component developer

### Component developer

-   As a component developer, I want to define the different variants for some of my components.\
    Example:
    -   Buttons (outlined/ solid/ rounded)
    -   Chips (outlined/ solid/ rounded)
    -   Inputs (outlined/ underlined)
-   As a component developer, I want to define some common default styles for all the components.
-   As a component developer, I want to replace the default styles for the components with different variants.
-   As a component developer, I want to define different [states](./states.md) and [sizes](./sizes.md) for each of my variant.

### Component consumer

-   As a component consumer, I want to create my own variants.
-   As a component consumer, I want to extend existing variants.
-   As a component consumer, I want to use existing variants in my components/product.
-   As a component consumer, I want to be able to overwrite the variant with inline styles.
-   As a component consumer, I want to use [design tokens](./design-tokens.md) to define the variant properties.
