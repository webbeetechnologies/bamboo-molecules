# User Input Fields

The document is aimed to be a common reference for user inputs. It's not intended to be an interface/type instead just a common reference :)\

## Personas

-   End User
-   Component Consumer

### End User

-   As an end user, I want that the feedback from the User input field field is instant.
-   As an end user, I want to be able to distinguish a [required](https://m3.material.io/components/text-fields/guidelines#6c36a812-273d-4f5d-9102-2f00386c9145) field from an optional input field.
-   As an end user, I want to be able to tell if there is an [error](https://m3.material.io/components/text-fields/guidelines#71d075ab-9fc6-4607-83f7-a0531c2f6b74) on the field.
-   As an end user, I want to see an error message in case there is one.
-   As an end user, where necessary I want to see extra description about the field.
-   As an end user, I want to be able to distinguish a disabled user input field from one that is not disabled.

### Component Consumer

-   As a component consumer, I expect the TextInput component to follow the platform specific guidelines.
-   As a component consumer, I want to be able to disable user input fields using a `disabled` prop.
-   As a component consumer, I want to define the styles for my component that are disabled.
-   As a component consumer, I want to define the styles for my components that have an error.
-   As a compinent consumer, I want to style my variats for the disabled and error states.
