# Design
Built upon Bamboo Atoms; they are already themable. The molecules are written with the specific guidelines from the platform this library supports.
Material components deeply follow M3 design philosophy and Cupertino heavily relies on the iOS style guide.


Molecules aims to closely mimic not just the ui of the components, but also interactions and transitions. It tries to be create a pixel perfect interface with a chance to enhance and extend the design externally at a granualar level.
