# useComponentTheme

- As a developer, I want to get the Component Styles stored in the Theme Provider by entering the Component Name.
- As a developer, I want to those styles to be normalized if they're the design tokens.
- As a developer, I want the Component Styles to be resolved by variants or the action states the component is in.
- As a developer, I want to enter the variant or the current state of the Component and get the output styles to be resolved according to the entered variant or the current state.
- As a developer, I want the flexibility to declare the states at the highest-level of the Component Styles object or inside the individual variant object, and I want the resolver to be smart enough to looking for them in those multiple places.
- As a developer, I want to set priority among the states so that one state's styles may override the other.
